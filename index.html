<b> SQL </b>>

While studying Computer Science at The University of Edinburgh, I learned courses such as database Systems where I learnt principles underlying the design and implementation of databases and DBMS, storing semi-structured data in XML documents and query language for XML and practical languages (SQL) for relational databases. I did software testing, software engineering and Software development courses.
In my honours project, I developed a walk sharing java application, which used a MySQL database to store user’s information, coordinates to make routes, and time schedules.
