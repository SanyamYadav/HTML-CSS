During my internship as a translation and transcription developer at Edinburgh University, I made the website for the Edinburgh University Exhibition called Highlands to Hindustan where I worked on the front end using HTML, CSS and Node JS and on backend server side code using PHP.I managed the project on Omeka Software , worked with agile
methodology , used Slack for communication and GitHub as version control repository hosting service.

<p2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At Fidelity National Financial, I was part of the Development Team of technology services vertical. 
I worked a login system application using ASP .Net, C sharp, HTML and CSS, SQL Server 2008 R2. 
I learnt how there technology services work and developed a login system
application. For my application, I wrote queries in SQL and designed the schema for storing user data.

</p2>



<p>
<b> SQL </b>>

<p2>

<br/>
While studying Computer Science at The University of Edinburgh, I learned courses such as database Systems where I learnt principles underlying the design and implementation of databases and DBMS, storing semi-structured data in XML documents and query language for XML and practical languages (SQL) for relational databases. I did software testing, software engineering and Software development courses.
In my honours project, I developed a walk sharing java application, which used a MySQL database to store user’s information, coordinates to make routes, and time schedules.
</p2>

<p2>
<br/>
   </br>

I made an application for my honours project which is called a walk and sharing app.
The principal goal of the project is to develop an app that allows people to find someone to walk with when they have a planned journey on foot.

Please check my WalkAndSharingApp on this link and the main file is (Main_.java)
This is the link that will take you to my honours project done completely in Java.

</br>
</br>
<strong>https://github.com/SanyamYadav/WalkAndSharingApp.git</strong>
</br>
</br>

I developed a walk sharing java application, which used a MySQL database to store user’s information, coordinates to make routes, and time schedules. It used different route finding, route drawing and route matching algorithms for this app. I used Google maps API, to pass http request returning JSON format output and then parse it to get the data.

   This project is about developing an app that allows people to find someone to walk with when they have a planned journey on foot. It is called a walk and sharing app.
Different route finding and matching algorithms have been presented with their drawbacks and advantages analysed.It presents how google maps directions API have been used to retrieve data such as route coordinates, time, distance and how to use this data is used for drawing the routes as it helps draw the most efficient routes.
It focuses on different matching algorithms used and their drawbacks and advantages.The evaluation of the matching algorithms and overall project has been presented too.Google Maps directions API indeed provide the most efficient routes and the matching algorithms used here show most adequate, correct results as we can decode the polyline. However, more matching algorithms can be used and they are described in further work.
For the database, MySQL rdbms has been used for designing schemas and retrieving and storing the user data. It was initially an android app but has been scaled down to a java server side application with all of the basic features implemented.
